# Assignment: Classes, Structs, and Enums in Swift


In this assignment, you will practice creating and using classes, structs, and enums in Swift. You will also learn how to define properties, methods, and constructors for these types, and how they differ from each other.

## Part 1: Classes and Structs
1. Create a new Xcode project as a command line tool.
2. In the main.swift file, define a new class called `Student` with the following properties: firstName, lastName, age, and grade.
3. Define a constructor for the class that takes in the student's firstName, lastName, and age as parameters and assigns them to the corresponding properties.
4. Define a method called getFullName() that returns the student's full name (concatenation of firstName and lastName).
5. Create an instance of the Student class in the main.swift file and set its properties with values of your choice.
6. Call the getFullName() method on the instance and print the result to the console.
7. Now create a struct called 'Point' with two properties 'x' and 'y' of int data type and define a constructor which assigns values of x and y properties.
8. Create an instance of Point struct and set the values of x and y.
10. Print the values of x and y.

## Part 2: Enums
1. Define an enumeration called "Department" with the following members: "Computer Science", "Math", "English", and "Physics".
2. In the Student class, add a new property called department of type Department.
3, In the constructor of the Student class, add an additional parameter for the Department and use it to set the value of the department property.
4. In the main.swift file, create an instance of the Student class and set its department to "Computer Science".
5. Print the value of the department property to the console.

## Part 3: Comparison
1. Create another struct called "Rectangle" with two properties width and height.
2. Create a new class called Size with two properties width and height.
3. Create instances of Rectangle and Size
4. Compare the instances and find the difference between structs and class in terms of how they are created and stored in memory.

## Part 4: Bonus
Create an extension of Student class that conforms to Comparable protocol.
Create a List of Student object, add some students and sort the list using sort()
Print the sorted list of students.
